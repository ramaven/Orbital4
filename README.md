# HEALth Together

Level of achievement: Artemis

We are Ruoyan and Rama and we are developing a mobile application called HEALth Together. HEALth Together is a digital healthcare ecosystem that provides end to end pain management support for patients - from the time when they start to feel any pain,  till they reach a doctor, and beyond.

## Problem Motivation 
Have you ever been to a doctor to explain the symptoms you’ve been facing, and were at a **loss of words** when trying to **remember exact descriptions of the symptoms and discomfort** you faced on each day, and which days you faced them?

With our hectic schedules, we probably just brush off an occurrence of pain and carry on with our work without delving much into it, and fail to keep track of important details about our body. As such, **we don’t know our bodies well enough.** 

With some **tracking**, we can be more conscious of what our body is going through, so that necessary attention to it can be given if needed. Hence, we hope to create a **simple yet structured and efficient pain and symptom tracking system.** 

Furthermore, seeking medical help has always been **an individual affair** — we visit the doctor alone, get the medicine alone and take the medicine alone. What if there is a **community** for people facing similar symptoms to come together, talk about it, and support one another?  Users can share their own journeys, and any tips that helped them tide through it. 

The community section will also feature healthcare webinars hosted by practitioners and healthcare experts (useful even for those without pain/symptoms), as well as feature insightful health articles and news catered to them, so you  **learn more about health and well-being** to take better care of your body!

Lastly, our app provides a **centralised platform where users can book an appointment in their chosen clinic/hospital.** Users  will be able to access a list of relevant clinics that they can visit and will be able to book an appointment with them.

## Proposed Core features 
1. Pain tracking 
   - An avenue for users to track their pains and symptoms in a more structured format and through 3D visualizations of the human body, that allows for more accurate tracking of their symptoms
     - Users can mark areas where they feel pain, the type of pain, how deep the pain is, does pain radiate to somewhere(If yes, can illustrate on the 3D diagram)
     - Can track frequency of different types of pains etc, as well as any activities that aggravated it

2. Community (forum) and learning (news feed) 
   - Through an interactive forum page, users can interact with other users and can find a “support” community of people who are experiencing similar ailments as them, and can share tips etc with one another
   - We also hope to boost users’ knowledge of the symptoms they face and update them on most recent health news and trends. For this, we will be having a news feed where we output the latest news in the health and medical scene, that is relevant to the user. To ensure its relevance to the user, we can use a simple recommender system. 

3. Finding Doctors
   - Users can search for relevant doctors based on some filters, and a list of suitable doctors to visit will be presented to them. We are hoping to enable the users to contact the doctors or book appointments via the application. 

## User stories 

1. As a person who wishes to keep track of my physical discomforts, I want to record down my pain and symptoms easily and see a history of my records. I also wish to be alerted if I have been experiencing certain symptoms too frequently, and a doctor’s visit might be necessary. 

2. As a person who wishes to talk to others who are experiencing the same physical discomforts, I want to have a community of people to discuss our symptoms with, and learn from their experiences. 

3. As a person who cares about my health seriously, I wish to have a newsfeed that gives me relevant articles on the topics I am interested in, be it diet or exercise, so that I can take better care of my body. As an administrator, I want to give the most relevant articles and news to the user based on the user’s profile and past interaction with the system. 

4. As a person who wishes to consult a doctor regarding my symptoms, I want to be able to choose a clinic or hospital and book an appointment with the relevant specialist doctor or general practitioner. 

5.  As an administrator who wants to prevent abuse of the system, I want to ensure that the forum discussions are informational with no personal attacks or vulgarities. Hence I can implement an automatic filter system that flags discussions that might not be suitable and disallow them to be posted, and we will personally review it to check its legitimacy and make the final call if that content should be taken down. 

6. As an administrator, I want to ensure that my user’s accounts are secured (firebase authentication) and ensure safety and reliability of the app (hosting on cloud).
